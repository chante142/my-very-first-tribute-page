                          Christopher Maurice Brown was born on May 5, 1989,[9] in the small
                          town of Tappahannock, Virginia,[10] to Joyce Hawkins, a former day
                          care center director, and Clinton Brown, a corrections officer at a
                          local prison.[11][12] He has an older sister, Lytrell Bundy,[13] who
                          works in a bank.[11] Music was always present in Brown's life
                          beginning in his childhood. He would listen to soul albums that his
                          parents owned,[12] and eventually began to show interest in the
                          hip-hop scene.
